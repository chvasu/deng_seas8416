        "# 1. My Feedback on Installing and Using VSCode, Anaconda, and Direct Python Virtual Environment Setups\n",
        "\n",
        "## VSCode (Visual Studio Code)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Installation and Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "**My steps to Install:**\n",
        "1. I downloaded VSCode from the website: https://code.visualstudio.com/.\n",
        "2. I ran the installer and followed the instructions.\n",
        "3. I installed Python and Jupyter extensions for VSCode from the Extensions Marketplace.\n",
        "4. I configured VSCode to use the Python interpreter by selecting it in the command palette.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "- **Easy installer setup:** VSCode installer is relatively lightweight and was set up pretty quickly.\n",
        "- **Has Terminal inside the IDE:** I could run shell commands directly within the editor.\n",
        "- **IntelliSense and Debugging:** I noticed the smart code completions as I type code and an integrated debugger making it suitable for advanced coding.\n",
        "- **Git Integration:** It has built-in Git support for version control. So, I connected it to my GitHub account.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "- **Extension Dependency:** I noticed the need for installing extensions for full functionality, which was taking extra space and memory of my system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage Comments\n",
        "- I had to install necessary extensions like Python, and Jupyter for a good Python development experience.\n",
        "- Initially, I used the integrated terminal for managing virtual environments and downloading packages using 'pip install' but later used the notebook and typed '!pip install package' to run commands directly from notebook without using the terminal.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Anaconda\n",
        "\n",
        "### Installation and Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps to Install:**\n",
        "1. I downloaded Anaconda from the website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution.\n",
        "2. I ran the installer and followed the instructions.\n",
        "3. I used the Anaconda prompt to create a new environment (name: deng), activated the new environment, installed the packages from the requirements.txt that I downloaded from https://github.com/kenclements/SEAS8416/blob/main/requirements.txt\n",
        "4. I ran the command: \"jupypter notebook\" and opened the web-browser based notebook (on Edge browser) to create this markdown and code notebook file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "- **All-in-One Package:** I like that Anaconda came with a wide range of packages and tools pre-installed.\n",
        "- **Conda Environment Management:** I like the simplified process of creating and managing isolated conda environments.\n",
        "- **Jupyter Notebook Integration:** It was easy to launch and use Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
        "- **Cross-Platform:** This tool is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "- **Large Download Size:** The installer is quite large, took significant disk space on my computer.\n",
        "- **Overhead:** This tool seems to use a lot of computer resources, so appears to have performance impact on my computer for heavy executions.\n",
        "- **Package Management Learning Curve:** I am familiar with pip, but had to learn conda on terminal to work with this tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage Comments\n",
        "- I used Conda to create separate environment for this course.\n",
        "- I didn't use the Anaconda Navigator yet, although I read about the GUI-capability of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Direct Python Virtual Environment Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "### Installation and Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps to Install:**\n",
        "1. I downloaded Python from the website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.\n",
        "2. Used `pip` to install `virtualenv` (`pip install virtualenv`).\n",
        "3. Created a virtual environment using `virtualenv deng`.\n",
        "4. Activated the virtual environment and installed jupyter and pandas packages, just to explore this approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "- **Lightweight:** I felt this setup is simple compared to Anaconda.\n",
        "- **Good for beginners:** It gave me clarity on what's happening inside Python, as we use other tools like Anaconda or VSCode.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "- **No GUI:** This lacks a graphical user interface for managing packages and environments, making it complex for beginners to use it directly.\n",
        "- **Dependency Conflicts:** I had multiple python versions so I had to delete old one until I realized the virutalenv package.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage Comments\n",
        "- I activated virtual environment (deng) before installing packages.\n",
        "- I didn't run `requirements.txt` from the GitHub site as I did that on Anaconda environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "In my opinion, each setup has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. I believe VSCode is good when we want to work with source control systems like Git. I prefer to use Anaconda as it is an all-in-one solution with easy environment management. The direct Python virtual environment setup is preferred for initial practice on understanding the language."
